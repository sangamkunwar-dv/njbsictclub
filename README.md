## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (v24 recommended)
- pnpm package manager
- Supabase account and project

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Database Setup

The database schema needs to be set up in Supabase. You have two options:

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project's SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/setup-db.sql`
3. Execute the script
4. Optionally, run `scripts/seed-data.sql` to add sample data

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🔐 Authentication

The app uses Supabase Auth with multiple providers:

- **Email/Password**: Standard email and password authentication
- **Google OAuth**: Sign in with Google account
- **GitHub OAuth**: Sign in with GitHub account

### Setting up OAuth

1. Go to your Supabase project settings
2. Navigate to Authentication > Providers
3. Enable Google and/or GitHub
4. Add your OAuth credentials from the respective provider consoles
5. Set redirect URL to: `https://your-domain/auth/callback`

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables

- **profiles**: User profile information with roles
- **members**: Team members with skills and social links
- **projects**: Showcase projects with tech stacks
- **project_members**: Many-to-many relationship for project team
- **events**: Community events and workshops
- **event_registrations**: User event registrations
- **team_leads**: Special team member designations

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled for security.

## 🎨 Design System

The app uses a carefully curated color palette with design tokens:

- **Primary**: Vibrant indigo (`oklch(0.6 0.25 280)`)
- **Accent**: Bright lavender (`oklch(0.65 0.28 270)`)
- **Background**: Deep charcoal (`oklch(0.08 0 0)`)
- **Foreground**: Light gray (`oklch(0.95 0.02 0)`)

Custom classes:
- `.glass`: Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- `.glass-hover`: Glass effect with hover state
- `.glow-accent`: Subtle glow effect with primary color

## 🔧 Key Features Explained

### Real-time Data

The team, projects, and events pages fetch data directly from Supabase and automatically update when database changes.

### Event Registration

Users can register for events through the Events page. The system tracks registrations and prevents duplicate entries.

### User Profiles

After logging in, users can update their profile information in the Profile page. Data is saved to the `profiles` table.

### Admin Features

The special email `sangamkunwar48@gmail.com` automatically gets admin privileges (role: 'admin'). You can extend this in the auth flow to enable admin panels.

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel project settings
4. Deploy!

```bash
vercel deploy
```

### Environment Variables for Production

Set these in your Vercel project settings:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "supabaseUrl is required" error

This happens at build time if Supabase env vars aren't set. The code handles this gracefully with placeholder values for production builds.

### Auth pages showing blank

Make sure the Supabase environment variables are correctly set in `.env.local` and match your Supabase project.

### RLS policy errors

If you get "row level security" errors, verify:
1. RLS is enabled on the table
2. The policy conditions match your authentication flow
3. The authenticated user has the appropriate role

## 📝 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the design tokens in `app/globals.css` under the `:root` and `.dark` sections.

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new directory in `/app`
2. Add `page.tsx` file
3. Import and use the `Navbar` and `Footer` components
4. Apply the `glass` styling for cards

### Extending Authentication

To add more OAuth providers:
1. Enable in Supabase dashboard
2. Update `hooks/use-auth.ts` with new sign-in methods
3. Add buttons to login/signup pages
